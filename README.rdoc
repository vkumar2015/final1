== README

Once you've started up your virtual machine and connected to it (with "vagrant ssh"), there are two ways you can get this code:

First, you can try the `catchup` command.  This command will attempt to connect to this repository and replace any code you have with the latest code here.

Alternatively, you can try this sequence:

1. Close Sublime Text.  If your rails server or console are running, stop them.
3. Using Windows Explorer/Mac Finder, completely delete your imdb folder.
2. In your vagrant@ command prompt: cd ~/code/projects
4. git clone https://github.com/kiei925-spring14/imdb
5. cd imdb
6. bundle install --without production
7. rake ez:tables
8. rake db:seed
